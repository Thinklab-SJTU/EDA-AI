	Modification Log:

	a-1:	10/05/96	warme
		: Created.
	b-1:	02/28/2001	warme
		: Changes for 3.1 release.
		: Renamed many members of "struct comp" -- we now
		:  prefer "vertex" over "terminal" and "edge" over
		:  "full set" or FST.
		: Replace "tmasks" and "kmasks" with new "rverts".
	e-1:	04/14/2015	warme
		: Changes for 5.0 release.
	e-2:	09/05/2016	warme
		: Change notices for 5.1 release.
	e-3:	09/24/2016	warme
		: Reorganize include files, apply prefixes.
