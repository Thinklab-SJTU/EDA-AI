Changed after first review for comp.sources.reviewed:

- Bug with row singletons and assignment fixed.
- Makefile fixed.
- Formatted man page (lp_solve.man) added + target to generate it in the
  Makefile
- install signal handler after reading the input to avoid dumping core
- changed names of some examples to make them uniform
- added correct results for all examples

Changes since the comp.sources.reviewed release:

- added more input sanity checking
- removed a bug in the Branch-and-Bound code which could cause umlimited
  recursion and finally a core dump
- removed the duplicate declaration of global variable Rows
- replaced bcopy by the ANSI standard memcopy
- various small cosmetic changes

Changes for version 1.1

- added KNOWN_BUGS file.
- accept x <= 0 as a sane bound.

Changes for version 1.2

- added (unsupported by me) VMS_SUPPORT file
- made lp_solve print the reason a problem cannot be solved (unbounded or
  infeasible)
- added input format extension to optionally indicate whether the objective
  function should be minimized or maximized.
- Added output(!) in real MPS format for the -v option.

Changes for version 1.3

- Added #ifdefs to handle the different definitions necessary for yytext on
  different computers. Why is there no standard???
- Fixed a very nasty bug in the parser which would handle variables on the
  right hand side of the relational operator which had an effective negative
  sign wrongly (actually, the negative sign was ignored).
- added -p option to print the values of the dual variables.
- Added test target in Makefile to allow automatic testing with the standard
  examples ex[1-5].lp.
- Added syntax extension for optional user specified constraint (dual) names.
- Fixed bug in the combination of minimization of the objective function
  (min: <obj fun>) and MILP problems. Pure LP worked ok.
- From now on lp_solve refuses problems with just bounds (0 real constraints).
  This does not work anyway.

Changes for version 1.4

- Various cosmetic changes to the sources
- Added ex6.lp just for fun (read it!).
- Added results obtained on netlib and miplib benchmark sets (thanks to
  mps2eq).
- removed pragmas for Alliant computers (they're out of business anyway).
- changed the default "double" type to REAL, which can be changed during
  compilation (-DREAL=float or -DREAL='long double')

Changes for version 1.5

- Added -scale option for global scaling of the problem.
- Fixed problem with Endetacol being written out of bounds.
- Added -autoscale option for automatic scaling of rows and columns.
- Added ex7.lp, an example which can only be solved when scaled properly.
- Added -solve_dual option to let lp_solve solve the dual of the problem it is
  reading. This is not a very useful option, but I needed it to check the
  results generated by the updated -p option (see next item). It will not work
  with equality constraints.
- The -p option now produces real dual values, thanks to a code hint by
  Jeroen Dirks (jeroend@tor.numetrix.com)
- The MILP branch-and-bound loop was rearranged by Jeroen Dirks resulting in
  significantly increased performance (2 - 10 times faster).


Changes for 2.0a

- Added a procedural interface (the lp toolkit).
- removed -scale and -solve_dual options
- renamed option -autoscale to -s

Changes for 2.0b1	

- Added -mps option to read MPS files. And also included some mps associated
  functions in the toolkit.

Changes for 2.0b2

- Fixed bug in:
	delete_lp
	del_constraint
	write_MPS
- added:
	write_LP
	msp2lp
	lp2mps

Changes for 2.0b3

- Changed default integer/noninteger value to 1e-3
- Added Epsb in Iteration function at minit detection
  (lp_solve gave infeasible for some feasible problems)
- Added -degen perturbation option for degenerate problems.

Changes for 2.0

- Removed "Parsing" message
- Made CHECK Warning output print to stderr

Changes for 2.1beta

- added '-time' option to print CPU times of parsing and optimization
- fixed some MPS reading problems
- allow empty OF in lp_solve format to get just a feasible solution
- added filtering of very small pivots to improve numerical stability
- fixed several bugs in lpkit.c and readmps.c

Changes for 2.1

- improved the speed of the MPS reader (considerably!) by introducing hash
  tables
- fixed bug in column_in_lp
- updated Jeroen Dirks' email address in the sources
- added HARTMUT_DOCUMENTATION to the distribution

Changes for 2.2

- fixed memory leak in delete_lp
- fixed some more lpkit.c bugs
- got rid of the ugly global variables used in solve.c. 

Changes for 2.3

- fixed memory problem in solve.c (eta arrays were not always realloc-ed on
  time).
- support for RANGES in MPS reworked; should now be according to standard
- option -degen could sometimes produce "results" for infeasible problems,
  fixed.
- previous versions of lp_solve would not scale any column when integer
  variables were present. Now only the actual integer columns are not scaled.
- copy_lp now also copies the rowname and colname hash tables
